# creditScoring

This project will also use R language to understand statistical tools used in credit scoring model building.  The R language is very much used by statisticians and data miners in data analysis and also for developing statistical software.R language offers the use of traditional approaches as well some cutting edge algorithms and techniques. As per the German Credit data which is a binary classifier problem of checking whether the loan will turn bad or good, traditional technique of Logistic Regression is used in the analysis, also traditional decision tree analysis. The cutting edge algorithms include Random forest, conditional inference trees, etc.

Moreover, the performance of such credit assessment models is judged by statistical tools like using the KS Statistic, GINI Coefficient, ROC (Receiver Operating Curve) or Area Under the ROC or using this curve itself. This study will also attempt to use such tools.

Detail of files are given below:

**credit_score_analysis.html** : This file contains all the code along with output in read-only format

**credit_score_code.Rmd** : This file is R Notebook which can be run in R-studio

**germanCredit.csv**: This is the free sample data set used in this project, download this to your local system and change the path in the code.

### The final comparasion between different models
